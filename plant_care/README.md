Plant Disease Detection using CNN and TensorFlow

This project is a Plant Disease Detection system that identifies diseases in plant leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow. The model achieves 98% accuracy, making it highly reliable for early detection of plant diseases.

Features

Detects multiple plant diseases from leaf images.

Built with CNN for accurate image classification.

Preprocessed dataset for better training performance.

High accuracy (98%) in predicting plant diseases.

Can be integrated with mobile or web applications for real-time detection.

Technology Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV / PIL (for image processing)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (for development and training)

Dataset

Includes a diverse set of plant leaf images with labeled diseases.

Preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation are applied to improve model performance.

How to Use

Clone the repository.

Install the required libraries using requirements.txt.

Load the pre-trained model.

Pass an image of a plant leaf to get disease predictions.

Applications

Agriculture: Early detection of plant diseases to prevent crop loss.

Research: Use as a baseline for further experimentation in plant disease classification.

Mobile/Web Integration: Can be deployed as a mobile or web app for farmers.



I uploaded the tflite model using mobileNet_V3 large architecture model which is efficient for mobile integration apps
